    "title": "Our Sudsy Story",
    "paragraphs": {
      "p1": "It all started when my boyfriend said, \"Honey, we should make soap!\" I thought he was being clean about our relationship, but no—he literally meant soap.",
      "p2": "Armed with nothing but recycled coffee grounds (because apparently throwing them away is a grounds for divorce) and an unreasonable amount of YouTube tutorials, we embarked on our lathery journey.",
      "p3": "The first batch? Let's just say it was a total wash. The second batch? A clean sweep of failures. But by the third batch, we finally got it right—and that's when things really started to soap up!",
      "p4": "Now we make all our soaps by hand in Germany, using only the finest natural ingredients and a healthy dose of questionable puns. Our motto? \"We're lye-ing if we say it's easy, but we're not lye-ing about the quality!\"",
      "p5": "P.S. My boyfriend insists I mention that she does 90% of the actual work. I provide moral support and terrible jokes. It's a clean division of labor. 🧼"
