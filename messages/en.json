    "title": "Our Sudsy Story",
    "paragraph1": "It all started when my boyfriend said, \"Honey, we should make soap!\" I thought he was being clean about our relationship, but no—he literally meant soap.",
    "paragraph2": "Armed with nothing but recycled coffee grounds (because apparently throwing them away is a <em>grounds</em> for divorce) and an unreasonable amount of YouTube tutorials, we embarked on our lathery journey.",
    "paragraph3": "The first batch? Let's just say it was a total wash. The second batch? A clean sweep of failures. But by the third batch, we finally got it right—and that's when things really started to <em>soap</em> up!",
    "paragraph4": "Now we make all our soaps by hand in Germany, using only the finest natural ingredients and a healthy dose of questionable puns. Our motto? \"We're lye-ing if we say it's easy, but we're not lye-ing about the quality!\"",
    "paragraph5": "P.S. My boyfriend insists I mention that she does 90% of the actual work. I provide moral support and terrible jokes. It's a clean division of labor. 🧼",
    "whyCoffeeGrounds": "Why Coffee Grounds?",
    "whyCoffeeGroundsText": "Because we're recycling champions and because coffee grounds are nature's best exfoliant. Plus, it gives us an excuse to drink more coffee during the \"research phase.\" Win-win! ☕"
